This website went through a major CSS refactor: repeated css variables across pages were moved to dedicated variable css files, lightmode css files were removed and lots of redundant/unused code was removed. I changed this because css files were getting too long and repetitive; making even the smallest styling changes required me to go through 3 different screen dimension for 2 different stylesheets (dark/light modes) for _every_ page. This refactor also enabled javascript improvements through a significant dark/light mode toggle refactor (converted into custom elements, allowing large chunks of repeated script code to be removed) and HTML changes (head was changed to include a styling link and a color palette link, divs were replaced by flexible custom elements).
